# INFO0940 - Operating Systems - Project 1

## How it works
When in the project directory, type in the terminal
```bash
make
```
which will compile the codes. Then, use
```bash
[valgrind] ./oshell
```
Where `valgrind` is used for debugging.
When the prompt `OShell>` appears, type the bash command you want to use. Then, follow the instructions.
